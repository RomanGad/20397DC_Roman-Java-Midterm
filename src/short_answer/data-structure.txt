***ANSWER ALL OF THE QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: Data structure provides a way of organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently. With the help of data
       structure, the data items can be traversed easily.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal and, Sorting

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer:

What is an Array?
Answer: An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
        The length of an array is established when the array is created.

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer: Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer: The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList .

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer: Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index. On the other hand,Linked
     list relies on references where each node consists of the data and the references to the previous and next element.

What is a Queue?
Answer: A queue is linear data structure that is used to store elements just like any other data structure but in
        a particular manner.

What is a Stack (referring to data structures)?
Answer: A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items
        always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the “top.” The end opposite the top
        is known as the “base.”

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out and ; it is a method for handling data structures
        where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last.
        LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is same as fist in, last out (FILO) and it is a method for
        handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: Big O Notation is a way to measure an algorithm's efficiency. It measures the time it takes to run our
        function as the input grows. Or in other words, how well does the function scale.

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The best case is linear search since it starts the searching from the beginning.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: The worst case is binary search, the searching starts after splitting the center of array.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer: A tree data structure is an algorithm for placing and locating files (called records or keys) in a database.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer: A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes. Let's try to
        understand this through an example.

What is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Answer: HashTable is a data structure type that stores the pairs of keys/values. It stores data in an array format.
        Out of this, every data value holds a unique index value of its own.
        is a collection class of Java that is Map-based- used for storing data keys in Value and Key pairs. The HashMap
        assists in the process of implementation of Java Map interface.

How do HashMaps work in Java? How do they store values, and when are they useful?
Answer: HashMap in Java works on hashing principles. It is a data structure that allows us to store object and
        retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key. HashMap stores the data in the pair of Key and Value.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When does it occur?
Answer: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is a subclass of IndexOutOfBoundsException, and it implements the Serializable
        interface and, it occurs whenever we are trying to access any item of an array at an index which is not present
        in the array. In other words, the index may be negative or exceed the size of an array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Answer: There are mainly different ways of copying an array into another array. Those are Manually, Array.copyOf(),
        System.arraycopy() and Object.clone().

What is DFS and BFS?
Answer: DFS is an algorithm for finding or traversing graphs or trees in depth-ward direction. The execution of the
        algorithm begins at the root node and explores each branch before backtracking.
        BFS is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures.
What is Recursion?
Answer: Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of)
        itself.

What are linear and non-linear data Structures?
Answer: A Linear data structure have data elements arranged in sequential manner and each member element is connected
        to its previous and next element.
        Nonlinear data structures are those data structures in which data items are not arranged in a sequence.
